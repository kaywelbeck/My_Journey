# üåê AWS Shield: DDoS Protection

---

## Overview of AWS Shield

**AWS Shield** is a managed DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) protection service designed to safeguard your applications from DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm a machine or network resource by sending excessive access requests, rendering it temporarily or indefinitely unavailable.

## üö® Understanding DDoS Attacks

- **What is a DDoS Attack?**
  - A DDoS attack involves multiple unique IP addresses making repeated access requests to a website or application, which overloads the server and prevents legitimate users from accessing the service.
  - This can lead to significant downtime, similar to feeling overwhelmed by numerous tasks when you're understaffed at a busy restaurant or office.
