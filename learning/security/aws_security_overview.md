## Understanding Cloud Security Responsibilities

When moving any part of your technical infrastructure to the cloud, it's crucial to assess the security implications. Unlike on-premises data centers, where you have physical control, cloud data centers are managed remotely by AWS, often at undisclosed locations. This brings up important questions:

- Who secures the data centers?
- Who manages the servers and networks?
- Who updates the security patches?
- Who protects the data from corruption?

### The Shared Responsibility Model

AWS addresses these concerns through the **Shared Responsibility Model**, which delineates security duties between AWS and its customers.

## AWS's Responsibilities: Security **Of** the Cloud 🌐

AWS is accountable for the security of the foundational infrastructure that runs all AWS services. This includes:

- **Physical Infrastructure**: Data centers, servers, and the hardware that powers the AWS Cloud.
- **Software**: AWS’s managed services and their underlying software.
- **Networking**: The network infrastructure and its security controls.
- **Data Centers**: The facilities themselves, including their physical security.

### Think of it as:

AWS is responsible for securing the components that make up the cloud itself.

## Customer's Responsibilities: Security **In** the Cloud 🔐

As a customer, you are responsible for securing the elements that reside within AWS Cloud services. Your duties include:

- **Data Protection**: Encrypting your data and ensuring its integrity.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Controlling who has access to your cloud resources.
- **Application Security**: Securing your applications hosted on AWS.
- **Operating Systems**: Managing and patching virtual machines, EC2 instances, and other software.
- **Firewall Configurations**: Setting up and maintaining firewalls to control network traffic.

### Think of it as:

You are responsible for securing the things you put into the cloud.

## Key Takeaway

For the AWS exam and real-world scenarios, remember this crucial distinction: **AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, while you are responsible for security in the cloud**.
