## Understanding Databases

### Key Concepts

- **Data**: Raw facts and figures that can include words, numbers, phone numbers, etc.
  
- **Information**: Processed data that is meaningful and useful for decision-making.

- **Database**: An organized collection of data that allows for easy access, management, and updating.

### Models of Data Organization

- **Data Model**: Framework for organizing and structuring data within a database. It defines how data is stored, organized, and manipulated.

- **Relational Model**: A type of data model that organizes data into tables (relations) which can be linked—or related—based on data common to each. This model uses a structured query language (SQL) for accessing and managing data.
