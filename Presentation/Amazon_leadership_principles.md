Earning trust is one of Amazon’s core leadership principles. Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully.

##  Building Trust Through Empathy at a Water Park 🎢💧

#### **Situation** 🌟
I worked at a water park in Coventry, and on a particular day, the park offered access to vulnerable children and families. I was partnered with a deaf child who needed guidance and comfort to enjoy the water park experience.

#### **Task** 🎯
My task was to ensure the child felt comfortable and confident throughout their day, helping them enjoy the water rides without feeling limited by communication barriers.

#### **Action** ⚡
With my limited knowledge of British Sign Language (BSL), I communicated with the child, making sure they felt safe and understood. Before each ride, I would sign the word “confidence” to gauge whether they were comfortable going on the ride or if they preferred me to accompany them. This created a system where the child felt in control, allowing them to communicate their needs without feeling hindered.

#### **Result** 🎉
The child gained confidence throughout the day, participating in the rides and having a fun, carefree experience. By being able to communicate and respect their comfort level, I earned their trust, ensuring they could enjoy the day without limitations. My actions contributed to a memorable and enjoyable experience for the child and their family.

### Conclusion ✨
This experience demonstrates how trust can be built through empathy, clear communication, and respect for individual needs. By taking the time to understand and support the child’s comfort level, I not only earned their trust but also ensured they had a positive and fulfilling experience. Building trust is about being attuned to others’ needs and showing that you genuinely care about their well-being, which ultimately strengthens relationships and creates lasting positive outcomes.

# Amazon Leadership Principle: Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit 💪

Amazon values leaders who are willing to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when it’s difficult. Leaders need to voice their concerns when they believe something isn’t right, and once a decision is made, they commit fully to it. This principle promotes diverse thinking and ensures that decisions are made with multiple perspectives.

## Example: Improving Search Techniques as a Prison Officer 🛂

#### **Situation** 🌟
As a prison officer, I was stationed in the staff search department, where my team was responsible for searching staff, guests, and items such as tools and electronic devices brought into the prison. We also controlled access to the main prison through ID checks. I noticed that my colleagues were not conducting thorough searches, missing key areas where contraband could be hidden.

#### **Task** 🎯
I believed that the current search methods were inadequate and posed a risk to prison security. My task was to convince the team to improve their techniques, despite their belief that they were performing searches according to the code.

#### **Action** ⚡
To demonstrate the flaws in their approach, I devised a game where I would hide items such as pens or a lighter on my person, and my colleagues would take turns to find them during mock searches. They consistently failed to find the items, which illustrated the gaps in their search techniques. I used this exercise as a learning tool to show how they could improve their personal search methods.

#### **Result** 🎉
As a result of the exercise, the team acknowledged the shortcomings in their searches and adapted their techniques. This led to an increase in contraband seizures, as searches became more thorough and focused on areas that were previously overlooked. We began to pick up on items like aluminum foil and gum that were not allowed. Overall, prison security was enhanced, and staff became more confident in their ability to perform effective searches.

### Conclusion ✨
This experience demonstrates the importance of having the backbone to challenge established practices when necessary. By standing firm and proving the need for change, I was able to improve the security processes in our department. Once the team understood the value of the improvements, we all committed to the new procedures, which resulted in better outcomes for the prison’s safety and security.
