        <li>A VM runs on a physical computer, which is called a <span style="color:purple;">Host</span></li>
        <li>A software layer, which is called a <span style="color:purple;">Hypervisor,</span> provides access to the resources of the physical computer (CPU, memory, disk, and network) to the VM.</li>
        <li><span style="color:purple;">The VM runs its own operating system (OS)</span> and interacts with the host through the hypervisor.</li>
        <li><span style="color:purple;">Multiple VMs</span> can be provisioned on a single host.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<span style="color:purple;">Virtualization</span> gives you the ability to create multiple VMs, each with its own OS and applications, on a single physical machine.

A virtual machine (VM) is a computer that is emulated through software. It is virtual because it is not a physical computer.

<h4><u>Benefits of Virtual Machines</u></h4>

- <span style="color:green;">Cost savings –</span> You don’t need to buy a new machine if you want to run a different operating system (OS) on your existing machine. You can create a VM with the new OS and run it on your machine using virtualization software.
- <span style="color:green;">Efficiency –</span> Multiple VMs can run on a single physical computer, increasing utilization and reducing resource waste.
- <span style="color:green;">Reusability and portability –</span> You can copy a VM image to the same host or move it to another host to duplicate the environment.

## 📘 What is a Hypervisor?

A **hypervisor** is a software layer that enables the creation and management of **virtual machines (VMs)** by abstracting physical hardware. It allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, sharing the underlying hardware resources.

---

## 🛠️ Types of Hypervisors

### 1. **Type 1 (Bare Metal Hypervisors)** 🖱️
- **Runs directly on physical hardware** without needing a host OS.
- Used in enterprise environments like data centers.
- **Examples**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen.

### 2. **Type 2 (Hosted Hypervisors)** 💻
- **Runs on top of a host OS**, using it for hardware management.
- Often used in development and testing environments on personal computers.
- **Examples**: VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox.

## 🎯 Key Functions of a Hypervisor

- **🔄 Resource Allocation**: Distributes CPU, memory, storage, and other resources between virtual machines.
- **🛡️ Isolation**: Ensures VMs operate independently, so if one crashes, others remain unaffected.
- **⚙️ Virtual Machine Management**: Easily create, manage, and delete virtual machines.
- **💾 Hardware Emulation**: Simulates virtual hardware components like disk drives and network adapters.

## 🌟 Benefits of Using Hypervisors

- **💡 Efficient Use of Resources**: Maximizes hardware utilization by running multiple VMs on a single machine.
- **💰 Cost Savings**: Reduces the need for physical servers, lowering hardware and energy costs.
- **📈 Scalability**: Easily scale operations by adding or adjusting VMs without extra hardware.
- **⚡ Flexibility**: Run different operating systems on the same hardware, perfect for testing and development.

## 🛠️ Popular Hypervisor Software

- **VMware ESXi**: Widely used in large-scale data centers.
- **Microsoft Hyper-V**: Integrated into Windows Server, used in enterprise environments.
- **KVM**: Open-source hypervisor for Linux.

---

## 🖥️ Use Cases

- **Data Centers**: Large-scale virtualization, cloud computing environments.
- **Development & Testing**: Run multiple OS environments for testing software.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Quickly restore or replicate virtual machines for backup.
